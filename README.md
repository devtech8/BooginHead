# Customizations

This site includes a custom component called CYO (Create Your Own), which allows customers to design their own products.

The files for the custom CYO components are in these folders:

Presentation\Nop.Web\Content\Custom\cyo
Presentation\Nop.Web\Scripts\Custom\cyo
Presentation\Nop.Web\Views\Custom\cyo

(No controller just yet...)

(No configuration just yet ...)

The CYO partial currently renders on the Wishlist page.
